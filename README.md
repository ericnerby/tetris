# Tetris with JavaScript

This repo is a webpage with a tetris game. I followed the [tutorial available on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw).

In the 'refactor' branch, I'm going through and making the game more object oriented and eventually adding some additional features, like levels and a scoreboard.

Right now, this is all put together with front-end language, so you can just clone the repo and open index.html in a browser to play.
